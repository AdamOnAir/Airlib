# Notes

This is the planning document for the library.

## Objective

Airlib is similar to [Flixel](https://flixel.org/) and [FlashPunk](http://useflashpunk.net/). It has a very high abstraction layer and a simple API to facilitate game development.

## Old

The old library, [old.c](../src/old.c), will get some more functionalities :

- Unicode
- Placeholders, prefixes and helper texts
- Lists

## Features

Airlib support **Window management**, **Input/Output**, **Sprites**, **Audio** and  **Collisions**.
