# Notes

This is the planning document for the library.

## Objective

Airlib is similar to [Flixel](https://flixel.org/) and [FlashPunk](http://useflashpunk.net/). It has a Flash-like API and has a very high abstraction layer to facilitate game development.

## Old

- Unicode
- Placeholders,prefixes and helper texts
- Lists

## Features

Airlib support **Window management**, **Input/Output**, **Raster Images (bitmaps)**, **Audio** and  **Collisions**.
